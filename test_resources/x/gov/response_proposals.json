          "description": "Read here, or on https://ipfs.ink/e/QmRtR7qkeaZCpCzHDwHgJeJAZdTrbmHLxFDYXhw7RoF1pp\n\nThe Cosmos Hub's state machine handles spam prevention of governance proposals by means of a deposit system. A governance proposal is only considered eligible for voting by the whole validator set if a certain amount of staking token is deposited on the proposal. The intention is that the deposit will be burned if a proposal is spam or has caused a negative externality to the Cosmos community (such as wasting stakeholders’ time having to review the proposal).\n\nIn the current implementation of the governance module used in the Cosmos Hub, the deposit is burned if a proposal does not pass, regardless of how close the final tally result may have been. For example, if 49% of stake votes in favor of a proposal while 51% votes against it, the deposit will still be burned. This seems to be an undesirable behavior as it disincentivizes anyone from creating or depositing on a proposal that might be slightly contentious but not spam, due to fear of losing the deposit minimum (currently 512 atoms). This will especially be the case as TextProposals will be used for signaling purposes, to gauge the sentiment of staked Atom holders. Disincentivizing proposals for which the outcome is uncertain would undermine that effort.\n\nWe instead propose that the deposit be returned on failed votes, and that the deposit only be burned on vetoed votes. If a proposal seems to be spam or is deemed to have caused a negative externality to Cosmos communninty, voters should vote NoWithVeto on the proposal. If >33% of the stake chooses to Veto a proposal, the deposits will then be burned. However, if a proposal gets rejected without being vetoed, the deposits should be returned to the depositors.  This proposal does not make any change to the current behavior for proposals that fail to meet quorum; if a proposal fails to meet quorum its deposit will be burned."

We deem the issue to be of high severity, as if exploited it can potentially degrade the security model of the chain's Proof of Stake system.  This vulnerability CANNOT lead to the theft of Atoms or creation of Atoms out of thin air. \n\n All in Bits has released a source code patch, Gaia v0.34.6, that closes the exploitable code path starting at block 482100. \n\n The proposed upgrade code Git hash is:  80234baf91a15dd9a7df8dca38677b66b8d148c1 \n\n As a proof of stake, we are putting some collateral behind this legitimacy of this bug and patch and encourage others familiar with the report to do so as well.  If the disclosed bug turns out to be fabricated or malicious in some way, we urge the Cosmos Hub governance to slash these Atoms by voting NoWithVeto on this proposal. \n\n We encourage validators and all users to upgrade their nodes to Gaia v0.34.6 before block 482100.  In the absence of another public bulletin board, we request validators to please vote Yes on this proposal AFTER they have upgraded their nodes to v0.34.6, as a method of signalling the readiness of the network for the upgrade."

          "description": "Read here, or on https://ipfs.ink/e/QmRhQycV19QiTQGLuPzPHfJwCioj1wDeHHtZvxiHegTFDd \n\nThis proposal supercedes proposal number 9, which contains conflicting numbers in the title and body. \n\nIn the Cosmos Hub, the total number of active validators is currently capped at 100, ordered by total delegated Atoms. This number was originally proposed in the Cosmos whitepaper section titled [Limitations on the Number of Validators](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos/blob/master/WHITEPAPER.md#limitations-on-the-number-of-validators 4). This number was chosen as a relatively conservative estimate, as at the time of writing, it was unclear how many widely distributed nodes Tendermint consensus could scale to over the public internet.  \n\nHowever, since then, we have seen empirically through the running of the Game of Stakes incentivized testnet that Tendermint Core with Gaia state machine can operate with over 180 validators at reasonable average block times of <7 seconds. The Game of Stakes results empirically show that adding validators should not delay consensus at small block sizes. At large block sizes, the time it takes for the block to gossip to all validators may increase depending on the newfound network topology. However we view this as unlikely, and if it did become a problem, it could later be solved by known improvements at the p2p layer. The other tradeoff to increasing the number of validators is that the size of commits becomes ~25% larger due to more precommits being included, increasing the network and storage costs for nodes. This can also be resolved in the future with the integration of aggregate signatures. At the time of submission of this proposal, the minimum delegation to become a top 100 validator is 30,600 Atoms, a fairly high barrier to entry for new validators looking to enter the active validator set.  \n\nIn the Cosmos whitepaper, it states that the number of validators on the Hub will increase at a rate of 13% a year until it hits a cap of 300 validators. We propose scrapping this mechanism and instead increasing the max validators to 125 validators in the next chain upgrade with no further planned increases. Future increases to the validator set size will be originated through governance."

          "description": "This governance proposal is intended to act purely as a signalling proposal.  Throughout this history of the Cosmos Hub, there has been much debate about the impact that validators charging 0% commission has on the Cosmos Hub, particularly with respect to the decentralization of the Cosmos Hub and the sustainability for validator operations. \n\n Discussion around this topic has taken place in many places including numerous threads on the Cosmos Forum, public Telegram channels, and in-person meetups.  Because this has been one of the primary discussion points in off-chain Cosmos governance discussions, we believe it is important to get a signal on the matter from the on-chain governance process of the Cosmos Hub. \n\n There have been past discussions on the Cosmos Forum about placing an in-protocol restriction on validators from charging 0% commission.  https://forum.cosmos.network/t/governance-limit-validators-from-0-commission-fee/2182 \n\n This proposal is NOT proposing a protocol-enforced minimum.  It is merely a signalling proposal to query the viewpoint of the bonded Atom holders as a whole. \n\n We encourage people to discuss the question behind this governance proposal in the associated Cosmos Hub forum post here:  https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-are-validators-charging-0-commission-harmful-to-the-success-of-the-cosmos-hub/2505 \n\n Also, for voters who believe that 0% commission rates are harmful to the network, we encourage optionally sharing your belief on what a healthy minimum commission rate for the network using the memo field of their vote transaction on this governance proposal or linking to a longer written explanation such as a Forum or blog post. \n\n The question on this proposal is “Are validators charging 0% commission harmful to the success of the Cosmos Hub?”.  A Yes vote is stating that they ARE harmful to the network's success, and a No vote is a statement that they are NOT harmful."

An educational wiki for the Cosmos Hub parameters\n5. A best-practices document for parameter changes\n6. Monthly governance working group community calls (three)\n7. Monthly GWG articles (three)\n8. One Q2 2020 GWG recommendations article\n\nMilestones:\nBy end of Month 1, the Cosmos Governance Working Group (GWG) should have been initiated and led by Gavin Birch of Figment Networks.\nBy end of Month 2, Gavin Birch is to have initiated and led GWG’s education, best practices, and Q2 recommendations.\nBy end of Month 3, Gavin Birch is to have led and published initial governance education, best practices, and Q2 recommendations.\n\nDetailed milestones and funding:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mFEvMSLbiHoVAYqBq8lo3qQw3KtPMEqDFz47ESf6HEg/edit?usp=sharing\n\nBeyond the milestones, Gavin will lead the GWG to engage in and answer governance-related questions on the Cosmos Discourse forum, Twitter, the private Cosmos VIP Telegram channel, and the Cosmos subreddit. The GWG will engage with stake-holders to lower the barriers to governance participation with the aim of empowering the Cosmos Hub’s stakeholders. The GWG will use this engagement to guide recommendations for future GWG planning.\n\nRead more about the our efforts to launch the Cosmos GWG here: https://figment.network/resources/introducing-the-cosmos-governance-working-group/\n\n-=-=-\n\n_Problem_\nPerhaps the most difficult barrier to effective governance is that it demands one of our most valuable and scarce resources: our attention. Stakeholders may be disadvantaged by informational or resource-based asymmetries, while other entities may exploit these same asymmetries to capture value controlled by the Cosmos Hub’s governance mechanisms.\n\nWe’re concerned that without establishing community standards, processes, and driving decentralized delegator-based participation, the Cosmos Hub governance mechanism could be co-opted by a centralized power. As governance functionality develops, potential participants will need to understand how to assess proposals by knowing what to pay attention to.\n\n_Solution_\nWe’re forming a focused, diverse group that’s capable of assessing and synthesizing the key parts of a proposal so that the voting community can get a fair summary of what they need to know before voting.\n\nOur solution is to initiate a Cosmos governance working group that develops decentralized community governance efforts alongside the Hub’s development. We will develop and document governance features and practices, and then communicate these to the broader Cosmos community.\n\n_Future_\nAt the end of Q1, we’ll publish recommendations for the future of the Cosmos GWG, and ideally we’ll be prepared to submit a proposal based upon those recommendations for Q2 2020. We plan to continue our work in blockchain governance, regardless of whether the Hub passes our proposals.\n\n-=-=-\n\nCosmos forum: https://forum.cosmos.network/c/governance\nCosmos GWG Telegram channel: https://t.me/hubgov\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CosmosGov",

Adding governance control to all aspects of the CosmWasm contract lifecycle to make it compatible with the hub. Allowing governance to control code upload, contract instantiation, upgrades, and destruction (if needed).\n2. Adding ability to upgrade contracts along with migrations (also allowing orderly shutdowns). This controlled by a governance vote.\n3. Launch a testnet with working version of this code (Cosmos SDK 0.38 or 0.39) to enable all interested parties to trial the process and provide feedback.\n4. Provide sample contracts to demo on the testnet, along with some migration scenarios\n\nWithin 2 months, the working code and binaries should be delivered and open for public review. Within 4 months, these binaries will be used on a testnet, with sufficient staking tokens given to all active voters on the Cosmos Hub, and we will go through a few governance voting cycles to trial contract deployment and migrations (with a shorter voting cycles, eg. 3 days)\n\nDetailed milestones in the full proposal:\nhttps://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbD3bMajQCFmtDmkuRVWhmMWVdN2sK8QP2FoFCz9cjPiC\n\nBeyond the milestones, CosmWasm will enhance documentation of the platform and offer technical support on our Telegram channel.\n\n-=-=-\n\n_Problem_\nWith the upcoming launch of IBC, the hub will need to adapt more rapidly to the needs of the ecosystem, while also limiting chain restarts, which may be detrimental to IBC connections. In particular support for relaying Dynamic IBC Protocols and Rented Security, using ATOMs as collateral for smaller zones, would greatly benefit from CosmWasm's flexibility.\n\n_Solution_\nWe’re adding some key features to CosmWasm to convert it from a permissionless, immutable smart contract platform to a permissioned platform with governance control for upgrading or shutting down contracts. This is a key requirement to be able to integrate CosmWasm to the Cosmos Hub with minimal disruption.\n\n_Future_\nWe will continue development of CosmWasm, especially adding IBC integration as well as working towards a stable 1.0 release that can be audited and safely deployed (Q3/Q4 2020).\n\n-=-=-\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CosmWasm\nMedium: https://medium.com/confio\nTelegram: https://t.me/joinchat/AkZriEhk9qcRw5A5U2MapA\nWebsite: https://www.cosmwasm.com\nGithub: https://github.com/CosmWasm",

          "description": "cyber Congress (https://cybercongress.ai) developed Cyber (https://github.com/cybercongress/go-cyber): a software for replacing existing internet behemoth monopolies, such as Google, which exploited outdated internet protocols using the common patterns of our semantic interaction. These corps lock the information, produced by the users, from search, social and commercial knowledge graphs in private databases, and then sell this knowledge back as advertisement. They stand as an insurmountable wall between content creators and consumers extracting an overwhelming majority of the created value.\n\nWe propose ATOM holders to invest 10,000 ATOM from the community pool into the Takeoff of Cyber. In exchange, at the end of its donation round (https://cyber.page/gol/takeoff), and when an IBC connection will become possible, cyber Congress will transfer CYB tokens back to the community pool. Passing this proposal will transfer 10,000 ATOMs from the community pool to cyber Congress multisig (https://www.mintscan.io/account/cosmos1latzme6xf6s8tsrymuu6laf2ks2humqv2tkd9a).\n\nFull Proposal-Manifest text: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUYDQt9tqLQJwxnUck7dQY3XmZA3tDtpFh3Hchkg7oH46\n\nor at https://cyber.page/gol/takeoff\n\nThe software we offer resembles a decentralized google (https://github.com/cybercongress):\n- A protocol spec and the rationale behind it\n- go-cyber: our implementation using cosmos-sdk\n- cyber.page: PoC reference web interface\n- launch-kit: useful tools for launching cosmos-sdk based chains\n- cyberindex: GraphQL middleware for cyber\n- euler Foundation: mainnet predecessor of cyber Foundation: the DAO, which will handle all the donated ETH\n- documentation and various side tools\n\nCyber solves the problem of opening up the centralised semantics core of the Internet. It does so by opening up access to evergrowing semantics core taught to it by the users.\n\nEconomics of the protocol are built around the idea that feedback loops between the number of links and the value of the knowledge graph exist. The more usage => the bigger the knowledge graph => the more value => the better the quality of the knowledge => the more usage. Transaction fees for basic operations are replaced by lifetime bandwidth, which means usability for both, end-users and developers. You can think of Cyber as a shared ASIC for search.\n\nYou already see that the idea of Cyber evolves around content identifiers and its ranks. From here, welcome to Decentralized Marketing, or DeMa. You've certainly heard of DeFi. DeFi is built around a simple idea that you can use a collateral for something that will be settled based on a provided price feed. Here comes the systematic problem of DeFi: price oracles. DeMa is based on the same idea of using collateral, but the input for settlement can be information regarding the content identifier itself.\n\nWith the help of DeMa and IBC chains will be able to prove relevance using content identifiers and their ranks one to another. This will help to grow the IBC ecosystem, where each chain has multiple possibilities to exchange data, which is provably valued.\n\nCosmos was created to become the internet of blockchains. A protocol that propagates the spirit of decentralization and governed by the community. For such technology to succeed, a lot is required. One thing is a solid foundation it can build on. One virtue of such foundation is monetary flow of income that has to feed this machine for as long as it exists.\n\nA good question that arises is how to turn the community pool into a pool that isn’t (a) a pot of money which goes solely to network security, (b) a pool that isn’t solely a build-up of inflationary rewards and (с) has long term prosperity value (its value rises).\n\nThe solution to the above problem is to establish a fund, that is managed and processed collectively and consists of a diversified number of assets that can bring long term value to its stakeholders.\n\nThis means using the funds to support exceptional projects that are building with Tendermint and Cosmos-SDK. After all, is we want to glorify the ecosystem, we need for it to grow. How will it grow? It will have projects with a clear utility, amazing a product and provable distribution. This will attract users, developers and large stakeholders to the ecosystem. Together we already did one very successful investment decision. We all participated in cosmos fundraizer. So let us move the idea forward.\n\nIf this proposal is successful and stands for more demand from the public, we will open another proposal using the community pool. However, anyone can participate in Game of Links (https://cyber.page/gol/) or Takeoff https://cyber.page/gol/takeoff independently. If you have question you can ask them either on Cyber topic on Cosmos forum (https://forum.cosmos.network/t/cyber-a-decentralized-google-for-provable-and-relevant-answers) or Cyber forum (https://ai.cybercongress.ai).\n\nProposal results: https://www.mintscan.io/proposals/26",

          "description": "Stargate is our name for the process of ensuring that the widely integrated public network known as the Cosmos Hub is able to execute the cosmoshub-3 -> cosmoshub-4 upgrade with the minimum disruption to its existing ecosystem. This upgrade will also realize the Internet of Blockchains vision from the Cosmos whitepaper.\nIntegrations from ecosystem partners are at risk of breaking changes due to the Stargate changes. These changes drive the need for substantial resource and time requirements to ensure successful migration. Stargate represents a unique set of circumstances and is not intended to set precedent for future upgrades which are expected to be less dramatic.\nThere is a widespread consensus from many Cosmos stakeholders that these changes to core software components will enhance the performance and composability of the software and the value of the Cosmos Hub in a world of many blockchains.\nA Yes result on this proposal provides a clear signal that the Cosmos Hub accepts and understands the Stargate process and is prepared to approve an upgrade with proposed changes if the plan below is executed successfully.\nA No result would force a reconsideration of the tradeoffs in the Alternatives section and the forming a new plan to deliver IBC.\nSee the full proposal here: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmbo3fF54tX3JdoHZNVLcSBrdkXLie56Vh2u29wLfs4PnW"

Stargate brings the fundraiser period to the end with delivery of IBC. This proposal resolves the open business of active members of our community who cannot access their ATOM. This is an opportunity is opporunity to bring this business to a close and setup the agenda for IBC powered innovation comming in 2021.We strongly encourage the Cosmos Community to verify the cryptographic evidence and bring these community members to full ATOM holder status.\n\n\nFull Proposal:https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmV6pBgDppN7X3BdVW197EUe7dpcmcdLMivPa6xxtPj3aW \nThe original authors of the proposal will be available to answer questions on the Cosmos forum.\nhttps://forum.cosmos.network/t/updated-genesis-atoms-recovery-request-proposal/3905"
